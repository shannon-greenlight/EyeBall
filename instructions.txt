Assembly Instructions for the EyeBall

The EyeBall comes as two printed circuit boards, referred to as "the circuit board" and "the front panel" in this document.

Front Panel
The only components attached to the front panel are the hex stand-offs (SO1 - SO4) and the associated screws (SC1 - SC4).
Start by attaching the standoffs to the front panel.

Circuit Board
1. Install H1 - H4 on the bottom side of the circuit board.
2. Install discrete components and ICs. (save the longer trimmed leads for step 4.)
3. Install LEDs and Photo transistor. Use stand-off spacers to mount LEDs and the photo transistor. If these aren't available, 
	place circuit board onto the front panel standoffs and set the height of the component by pushing it into the hole in the front panel. 
	Solder the component into place and remove the circuit board from the front panel to continue assembly.
4. Install potentiometers. Use trimmed component leads to connect potentiometers to the circuit board.
5. Install Jacks. Make sure all jacks are seated flush to the circuit board.
6. Clean the board with flux remover. (optional)
7. Test it.
8. If everything works, assemble the to parts and you're ready to go!
